        <p>
Always seeking clean simple solutions over the complex and have a need to do things
the right way. Outside of work I enjoy socialising, camping, walking, fishing, going to gigs,
playing music (I play guitar and bass) with friends and tinkering around with computers, either
programming, playing games or checking out the latest Linux distro. Goals for this year include
diving deeper into Phaser3, a Javascript framework used to create games - so I can finally make
that turn based RPG I have in mind :)
